					<p>
						I've been training dogs for like a million years and I've helped thousands of people solve thousands of problems so they can live the best lives possible with their four-legged companions.
					</p>
					<p>
						I have a background in ethology, and a passion for rescue. This blurb can be a little longer than that too talking about general experience, philosophy, relatable life stuff etc.
					</p>
					<p>
						I live with my 5 dogs, 2 cats, and 1 husband.
